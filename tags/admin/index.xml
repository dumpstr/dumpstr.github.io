    <description><![CDATA[quick update to my life, homies.
i spilled tea on my trusty kb talking keyboard with cherry mx brown switches that i bought from massdrop in ~2012.
it is now functioning inconsistently, so i have to replace it.

    <description><![CDATA[hello my dearest webzone readers,
i have made a full recovery after being devastated by a tumultuous, interpersonal conflict. huzzah!
some actions that really help me out when i&rsquo;m not feeling too hot:
 go for a walk eat healthy foods sit quietly; do nothing listen to some sad songs talk to my friends  overall, the above list reads like a bunch of platitudes and won&rsquo;t work for everyone, but atleast they work for me!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[hello my dearest webzone readers,
i&rsquo;m going through some mild turmoil right now. understandably, i&rsquo;ve been neglecting updating my fledgling site. despite how reasonable it is to drop this hobby to tend to my emotional damage, i feel like i have let you, dear reader, down.

though these events have decimated my mental, i believe i will make a full recovery and return to learning how to maintain this website and maybe even write something interesting.]]></description>
