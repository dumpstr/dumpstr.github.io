    <description><![CDATA[quick update to my life, homies.
i spilled tea on my trusty kb talking keyboard with cherry mx brown switches that i bought from massdrop in ~2012.
it is now functioning inconsistently, so i have to replace it.

    <description><![CDATA[hello my dearest webzone readers,
i have made a full recovery after being devastated by a tumultuous, interpersonal conflict. huzzah!
some actions that really help me out when i&rsquo;m not feeling too hot:
 go for a walk eat healthy foods sit quietly; do nothing listen to some sad songs talk to my friends  overall, the above list reads like a bunch of platitudes and won&rsquo;t work for everyone, but atleast they work for me!]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[hello my dearest webzone readers,
i&rsquo;m going through some mild turmoil right now. understandably, i&rsquo;ve been neglecting updating my fledgling site. despite how reasonable it is to drop this hobby to tend to my emotional damage, i feel like i have let you, dear reader, down.

though these events have decimated my mental, i believe i will make a full recovery and return to learning how to maintain this website and maybe even write something interesting.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[i enjoy playing wordle in the morning, even if i&rsquo;m not very good at it.
it&rsquo;s kind of like scrabble without any of the commitment.
an unintended consequence of trying to share this was having to change the configuration of this dumb site to allow emojis and learn some markdown, but what a pain.
good new is that i now can unnecessarily emphasize things and slap emojis everywhere ðŸ¤ª
take care, dear readers ðŸ™‚]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[i&rsquo;ve been listening to this john congleton and the nighty nite album on repeat. it encapsulates some feelings that i&rsquo;ve been harboring for a little bit. he addresses existential dread and the transience of life in an interesting way.
standouts: animal rites, your temporary custodian, canaries in the coal mine, who could love you lucille?, you are facing the wrong way]]></description>
